Description of Working Group:
  
  This Working Group is charged with maintaining and developing
  the "core" specifications for the Activity Streams format and 
  protocol.
  
  The Working Group's specification deliverables are:
  
  * A document describing an updated conceptual model 
    for an "activity" and "activity stream" that is fully
    backwards compatible with the existing JSON Activity 
    Streams 1.0 model defined at http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/
    but incorporates important lessons learned and best 
    practices learned through implementation experience.
  * A document that describes a core set of verbs, object types
    and general extension properties for use with the 
    Activity Streams format and establishes a registry 
    for tracking and extending new verbs, object types 
    and extensions.
  * One or more documents describing general extensions 
    to the Activity Streams model including:
    * An extension for representing responses to activities
    * An extension for explicitly identifying the target 
      audience of an activity
    * An extension supporting the definition of new 
      extension verbs and object types. 
    * 
  * A document describing a basic protocol for the publication
    of activities. This protocol must enable the publication, 
    distribution and aggregation of activities and activity 
    streams. The creation, editing and deleting of individual
    activities is not considered to be a goal of the protocol.
  
  The working group will build on the work already done by the 
  existing Activity Streams community (http://activitystrea.ms)
  and will leverage experience gained through the implementation
  of the JSON Activity Streams 1.0 format as the basis for
  standards track documents that are fully backwards compatible 
  with the JSON Activity Streams 1.0 format. Changes to the 
  existing semantics or significant new required capabilities 
  within the core Activity Streams model are out of scope. 
  The working group may, however, consider optional extensions 
  and capabilities that do not alter the existing semantics.
  
  The Working Group will utilize the following external document
  specifications as initial input:
  
  * http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/
  * http://activitystrea.ms/specs/atom/1.0/
  * http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/schema/activity-schema.html
  * http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/targeting/1.0/
  * http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/replies/1.0/

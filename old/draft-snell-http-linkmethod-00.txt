Internet-Draft        HTTP Link and Unlink Methods          January 2012


1.  Introduction

   TBD

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  LINK

   The LINK method requests that a link relationship be established
   between the target resource and one or more other resources specified
   within the request.  The resources for which a link is to be
   established, and the nature or purpose of the link is specified using
   one or more Web Link Headers as specified by [RFC5988].

   For example, to request the creation of a link between a target
   resource located at "http://example.org/foo" and a resource located
   at "http://example.com/bar" such that the latter is considered an
   alternate of the former, the request would be:

     LINK /foo HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Link: <http://example.com/bar>; rel="alternate"

   Multiple Link headers can be used to establish multiple links:

     LINK /foo HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Link: <http://example.com/bar>; rel="alternate",
       <http://example.net/baz>; rel="tag"

   A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes a
   representation describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action
   has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been
   enacted but the response does not include a representation.

   Exactly how an established link manifests within the state of the
   target resource is up to the server implementation and there is no
   guarantee that links established using the LINK method, or any
   changes in state that occur as a result of the link, will be
   observable by the user agent.  A successful response only implies
   that the user agent's intent was achieved at the time of its
   processing by the origin server.

   Bodies on LINK requests have no defined semantics.

   Multiple, identical LINK requests are idempotent.  Link headers
   SHOULD be considered identical if they specify the same combination
   of Target IRI and Relation Type, where Target IRI's are compared
   character-by-character in a case-sensitive fashion and Relation Types
   are compared character-by-character in a case-insensitive fashion.
   If multiple rel values are specified within the Link header, the
   ordering of those rel values is insignificant when comparing Links.

   For example, the following SHOULD be considered identical:

    Link: <http://example.org/foo>; rel="alternate edit"
    Link: <http://example.org/foo>; rel="Alternate Edit"
    Link: <http://example.org/foo>; rel="edit alternate"
    Link: <http://example.org/foo>; rel="Edit Alternate"
    Link: <http://example.org/foo>; rel="alternate",
      <http://example.org/foo>; rel="edit"

   While the following SHOULD NOT be considered identicial:

    Link: <http://example.org/foo>; rel="alternate edit"
    Link: <http://example.org/FOO>; rel="alternate edit"

   This specification does not define exactly how LINK affects the state
   of an origin server beyond what can be expressed by the intent of the
   user agent request and the semantics of the origin server response.
   Generally speaking, all implementation details behind the resource
   are intentionally hidden by the server.

   The successful processing of a LINK request might not result in a
   significant change of state on the origin server.  That is, the state
   of the target resource might not be changed to the extent that the
   resource's Validators (Entity Tag or Last Modified) are modified.

   Responses to the LINK method are not cacheable.  Because it is not
   possible for a Cache to determine whether the successful application
   of a LINK request will result in an observable change of state on the
   origin-server, the Cache MUST assume the method is not safe and MUST
   invalidate the effective Request URI.


3.  UNLINK

   The UNLINK method requests the removal of an existing link
   relationship between the target resource and one or more other
   resources specified within the request.  The links to be removed are
   specified using one or more Web Link Headers.

   For example, to request the removal of an existing link between a

   target resource located at "http://example.org/foo" and a resource
   located at "http://example.com/bar", the request would be:

     UNLINK /foo HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Link: <http://example.com/bar>; rel="alternate"

   Multiple Link headers can be used to request the removal of multiple
   links:

     UNLINK /foo HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Link: <http://example.com/bar>; rel="alternate",
       <http://example.net/baz>; rel="tag"

   A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes a
   representation describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action
   has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been
   enacted but the response does not include a representation.

   There is no guarantee that any changes in state that occur as a
   result of removing the link will be observable by the user agent.  A
   successful response only implies that the user agent's intent was
   achieved at the time of its processing by the origin server.

   Bodies on UNLINK requests have no defined semantics.

   Multiple, identical UNLINK requests are idempotent.  Link headers
   SHOULD be considered identical following the same rules established
   above for the LINK request.

   This specification does not define exactly how UNLINK affects the
   state of an origin server beyond what can be expressed by the intent
   of the user agent request and the semantics of the origin server
   response.  Generally speaking, all implementation details behind the
   resource are intentionally hidden by the server.

   The successful processing of an UNLINK request might not result in a
   significant change of state on the origin server.  That is, the state
   of the target resource might not be changed to the extent that the
   resource's Validators (Entity Tag or Last Modified) are modified.

   Responses to the UNLINK method are not cacheable.  Because it is not
   possible for a Cache to determine whether the successful application
   of an UNLINK request will result in an observable change of state on
   the origin-server, the Cache MUST assume the method is not safe and
   MUST invalidate the effective Request URI.

4.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

   Specific preferences requested by a client can introduce security
   considerations and concerns beyond those discussed in HTTP/1.1 Parts
   1 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging], 2 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics],
   3 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p3-payload], 4 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional],
   5 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p5-range], 6 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache], and 7
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth].  Implementors must refer to the
   specifications and descriptions of each preference to determine the
   security considerations relevant to each.

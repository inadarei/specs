      <t>This specification describes the "priority" extension for JSON Activity Streams.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="priority-property" title="The &quot;priority&quot; property">      
      <t>Priority is an indicator of the relative priority or importance 
      that the generator of an <spanx style="verb">activity</spanx> object 
      considers the activity to have. Represented in JSON as a property called
      <spanx style="verb">priority</spanx> whose value is a numeric decimal
      between 0.00 and 1.00. If the property is omitted, or explicitly set
      to a value of null, the assumption is that no explicit 
      priority or importance can be assumed. All other values falling
      between 0.0 and 1.0 indicate relatively increasing priority.</t>
        
      <t>For example:</t>  
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  {
    "actor": {"displayName": "Joe"},
    "verb": "post",
    "object": {
      "objectType": "note",
      ...
    },
    "priority": 0.75
  }
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>Note that the presence of the <spanx style="verb">priority</spanx>
      property is intended only to communicate the intended relative importance 
      of the activity from the generators point of view and does not impose
      any specific processing or display requirements on the part of any 
      entity consuming the activity stream.</t>
          
      <t>Expressing the value as a range of numeric decimal values is intended
      to provide the greatest level of flexibility in the expression and 
      consumption of prioritization detail. It is expected that implementors 
      consuming activity streams containing <spanx style="verb">priority</spanx> 
      will utilize and expose the additional information in a number
      of different ways depending on the unique requirements of each 
      application use case.</t>
          
      <t>Many existing systems do not typically represent priority values as
      numeric ranges. Such systems typically use fixed, labeled brackets such
      as "low", "normal" and "high" or "urgent". Similar mechanisms can be
      established, by convention, when using the <spanx style="verb">priority</spanx>
      property. In typical use, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations wishing 
      to work with such defined categories treat <spanx style="verb">priority</spanx> 
      property values in the range 0.00 to 0.25 as "low" priority; values 
      greater than 0.25 to 0.75 as "normal" priority; and values greater than
      0.75 to 1.00 as "high" priority. Specific implementations are free to
      establish alternative conventions for the grouping of priority values
      with the caveat that such conventions might not be understood by all 
      implementations.</t>

1.  The "handler" property

   Within an Activity object, the "handler" property is used to describe
   an object that is capable of performing or completing the activity.
   The value of the "handler" property is an Object of any objectType.
   The meaning of the "handler" property is only defined when used
   within an Activity object.

   For example:

     {
       "verb": "watch",
       "object": {
         "objectType": "video",
         "displayName": "Skyfall",
         "url": "http://skyfallmovie.com"
       },
       "handler": {
         "objectType": "application",
         "displayName": "Movie Service",
         "platform": "Android",
         "platformVersion": "2.1",
         "appId": "123456abcdef",
         "url": "movie://play?movie=skyfall"
       }
     }


2.  The "handles" property

   Within an object of any objectType, the "handles" property describes
   Activities or Tasks the object is capable of acting as a "handler"
   for.  The value of the "handles" property is a JSON array containing
   one or more JSON objects that describe, at a minimum, a possible
   combination of verb, actor, object and target values.

   +--------+-----------------------+----------------------------------+
   | Field  | Type                  | Description                      |
   +--------+-----------------------+----------------------------------+
   | actor  | JSON Array of Strings | Specifies one or more            |
   |        |                       | objectTypes.                     |
   | object | JSON Array of Strings | Specifies one or more            |
   |        |                       | objectTypes.                     |
   | target | JSON Array of Strings | Specifies one or more            |
   |        |                       | objectTypes.                     |
   | verb   | JSON Array of Strings | Specifies one or more Verbs      |
   +--------+-----------------------+----------------------------------+

   The example below decribes a fictional media player application for
   Android that can be used to complete "watch" and "rent" activities
   for "video" and "audio" objects.

     {
       "objectType": "application",
       "displayName": "Media Player for Android",
       "platform": "Android",
       "platformVersion": "2.1",
       "appId": "123456abcdef",
       "handles": [
         {
           "verb": ["watch","rent"],
           "object": ["video","audio"]
         }
       ]
     }


3.  The "action" property

   Used within objects of any objectType, the "action" property
   describes one or more tasks (pending activities) for which the
   containing object can be an "object".  The value is represented as a
   JSON array of one or more Task objects.  Each contained task object
   is one possible pending activity that could occur.

   For example, the following describes a video object with multiple
   associated possible actions:

     {
       "objectType": "video",
       "displayName": "Skyfall",
       "url": "http://skyfallmovie.com",
       "action": [
         {
           "verb": "watch",
           "handler": {
             "objectType": "application",
             "displayName": "Movie Service",
             "platform": "Android",
             "platformVersion": "2.1",
             "appId": "123456abcdef"
           },
           "url": "movie://play?movie=skyfall"
         },
         {
           "verb": "review",
           "handler": {
             "objectType": "application",
             "displayName": "Rating Service",
             "platform": "Android",
             "platformVersion": "2.1",
             "appId": "abcdef123456"
           },
           "url": "rating://movie?id=skyfall"
         }
       ]
     }


4.  The "status" property

   Within an Activity or Task object, the "status" property specifies
   the current status of the activity.  The value is a JSON string
   specifying one of:

   tentative  The activity or task has been proposed.

   pending  The activity or task is in progress but has not yet
      concluded.

   completed  The activity or task has been completed.

   canceled  The activity or task has been canceled.

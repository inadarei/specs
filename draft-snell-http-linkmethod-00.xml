      <t>In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", 
      "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
      are to be  interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t> 
 
    </section> 
    
    <section anchor="link" title="LINK">
      <t>The LINK method requests that a link relationship be established 
      between the target resource and one or more other resources specified
      within the request. The resources for which a link is to be established, 
      and the nature or purpose of the link is specified using one or more 
      Web Link Headers as specified by <xref target="RFC5988"/>.</t>
      
      <t>For example, to request the creation of a link between a target resource 
      located at "http://example.org/foo" and a resource located at 
      "http://example.com/bar" such that the latter is considered an 
      alternate of the former, the request would be:</t>
      
      <figure><artwork>
  LINK /foo HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.org
  Link: &lt;http://example.com/bar&gt;; rel="alternate"
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>Multiple Link headers can be used to establish multiple links:</t>
      
      <figure><artwork>
  LINK /foo HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.org
  Link: &lt;http://example.com/bar&gt;; rel="alternate",
    &lt;http://example.net/baz&gt;; rel="tag"
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes
      a representation describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action 
      has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been
      enacted but the response does not include a representation.</t>
      
      <t>Exactly how an established link manifests within the state of the 
      target resource is up to the server implementation and there is no 
      guarantee that links established using the LINK method, or any changes
      in state that occur as a result of the link, will be observable by the 
      user agent. A successful response only implies that the user agent's 
      intent was achieved at the time of its processing by the origin server.</t>
      
      <t>Bodies on LINK requests have no defined semantics.</t>
      
      <t>Multiple, identical LINK requests are idempotent. Link headers 
      SHOULD be considered identical if they specify the same combination 
      of Target IRI and Relation Type, where Target IRI's are compared 
      character-by-character in a case-sensitive fashion and Relation
      Types are compared character-by-character in a case-insensitive 
      fashion. If multiple rel values are specified within the Link 
      header, the ordering of those rel values is insignificant when 
      comparing Links.</t>
      
      <t>For example, the following SHOULD be considered identical:</t>
      
      <figure><artwork>
 Link: &lt;http://example.org/foo&gt;; rel="alternate edit"
 Link: &lt;http://example.org/foo&gt;; rel="Alternate Edit"
 Link: &lt;http://example.org/foo&gt;; rel="edit alternate"
 Link: &lt;http://example.org/foo&gt;; rel="Edit Alternate"
 Link: &lt;http://example.org/foo&gt;; rel="alternate",
   &lt;http://example.org/foo&gt;; rel="edit"
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>While the following SHOULD NOT be considered identicial:</t>
      
      <figure><artwork>
 Link: &lt;http://example.org/foo&gt;; rel="alternate edit"
 Link: &lt;http://example.org/FOO&gt;; rel="alternate edit"
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>This specification does not define exactly how LINK affects the 
      state of an origin server beyond what can be expressed by the intent
      of the user agent request and the semantics of the origin server 
      response. Generally speaking, all implementation details behind the
      resource are intentionally hidden by the server.</t>
      
      <t>The successful processing of a LINK request might not result in
      a significant change of state on the origin server. That is, the 
      state of the target resource might not be changed to the extent that
      the resource's Validators (Entity Tag or Last Modified) are modified.</t>
      
      <t>Responses to the LINK method are not cacheable. Because it is not
      possible for a Cache to determine whether the successful application of
      a LINK request will result in an observable change of state on the 
      origin-server, the Cache MUST assume the method is not safe and MUST
      invalidate the effective Request URI. </t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="unlink" title="UNLINK">

      <t>The UNLINK method requests the removal of an existing link relationship 
      between the target resource and one or more other resources specified
      within the request. The links to be removed are specified using one or more 
      Web Link Headers.</t>
      
      <t>For example, to request the removal of an existing link between a 
      target resource located at "http://example.org/foo" and a resource 
      located at "http://example.com/bar", the request would be:</t>
      
      <figure><artwork>
  UNLINK /foo HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.org
  Link: &lt;http://example.com/bar&gt;; rel="alternate"
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>Multiple Link headers can be used to request the removal of multiple links:</t>
      
      <figure><artwork>
  UNLINK /foo HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.org
  Link: &lt;http://example.com/bar&gt;; rel="alternate",
    &lt;http://example.net/baz&gt;; rel="tag"
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes
      a representation describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action 
      has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been
      enacted but the response does not include a representation.</t>
      
      <t>There is no guarantee that any changes in state that occur as a result 
      of removing the link will be observable by the  user agent. A successful 
      response only implies that the user agent's intent was achieved at the 
      time of its processing by the origin server.</t>
      
      <t>Bodies on UNLINK requests have no defined semantics.</t>
      
      <t>Multiple, identical UNLINK requests are idempotent. Link headers 
      SHOULD be considered identical following the same rules established
      above for the LINK request.</t>
      
      <t>This specification does not define exactly how UNLINK affects the 
      state of an origin server beyond what can be expressed by the intent
      of the user agent request and the semantics of the origin server 
      response. Generally speaking, all implementation details behind the
      resource are intentionally hidden by the server.</t>
      
      <t>The successful processing of an UNLINK request might not result in
      a significant change of state on the origin server. That is, the 
      state of the target resource might not be changed to the extent that
      the resource's Validators (Entity Tag or Last Modified) are modified.</t>
      
      <t>Responses to the UNLINK method are not cacheable. Because it is not
      possible for a Cache to determine whether the successful application of
      an UNLINK request will result in an observable change of state on the 
      origin-server, the Cache MUST assume the method is not safe and MUST
      invalidate the effective Request URI. </t>

      <t>Specific preferences requested by a client can introduce security
